# Mini_project_weak3

#what did i do and why :-

-#first -> Loaded the dataset, viewed summary statistics, and defined a cleaning plan for each column (age, income, city, signup_time).

-#Types-> i converted data types to allow for : operations, handeling errors.
-#missing values-> i controled missing value by  using imputation.

-#duplicates -> i identified and removed duplicate rows based on 'income', 'city' and 'signup_time' columns.

-#outliers -> i handled outliers by clipping 'income' at the 99th percentile and applying a log transformation to 'age'.

-#Strings and dates -> standardized 'city' names, replaced custom missing values, localized 'signup_time' to UTC.


- #Data Cleaning: Applied the cleaning pipeline, reviewed summary statistics, checked missing values, and saved the cleaned dataset to 'clean_data.csv'.
